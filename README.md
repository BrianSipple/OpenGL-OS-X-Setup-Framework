# OpenGL on OS X Yosemite -- Setup Framework
 A framework of setup code for creating an OpenGL project in C++ on OS X Yosemite, using GLFW3 and GLEW.

All code is intended to be fully functional from the command line via the use of Makefiles (no need for XCode or CMake), and incorporates useful third-party libraries such as GLFW3 and GLEW.
